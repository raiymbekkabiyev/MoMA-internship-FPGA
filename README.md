# Acceleration of Fully Homomorphic Encryption using Intel Arria Acceleration Cards

Keynotes: FPGA, Fully Homomorphic Encryption, Intel Arria Acceleration Cards

## Description: 
This research looks into Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) which is a relatively new technology dedicated to provide absolute confidentiality for a user while using third party cloud-based servers. FHE is promising technology that allows manipulation on encrypted data without revealing private data. However, FHE is computationally heavy and thus slow process. This research project aims to accelerate these computations (addition and multiplication) using Intel Arria Acceleration Cards.
